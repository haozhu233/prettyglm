Description: One of the main advantages of using Generalised
    Linear Models is their interpretability.  The goal of 'prettyglm' is to
    provide a set of functions which easily create beautiful coefficient
    summaries which can readily be shared and explained. prettyglm helps 
    users create coefficeint summaries which include categorical base levels,
    variable importance and type III p.values. prettyglm also creates 
    beautiful relativity plots for categorical, continuous and splined coefficients.
