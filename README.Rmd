One of the main advantages of using Generalised Linear Models is their interpretability.  The goal of prettyglm is to provide a set of functions which easily create beautiful coefficient summaries which can readily be shared and explained.

## Forword 

`prettyglm` was created to solve some common faced when building Generalised Linear Models, such as displaying categorical base levels, and visualizing the number of records in each category on a duel axis. Since then a number of other functions which are useful when fitting glms have been added.

If you don't find the function you are looking for here consider checking out some other great packages which help visualize the output from glms:
  - `tidycat` 
  - `jtools`

## Installation

You can install the latest CRAN release with:

``` r
install.packages('prettyglm')
```

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jared-fowler/prettyglm")
```

## A Simple Example

To explore the functionality of prettyglm we will use a data set sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/volodymyrgavrysh/bank-marketing-campaigns-dataset which contains information about a Portugal banks marketing campaigns results. The campaign was based mostly on direct phone calls, offering clients a term deposit. The target variable `y` indicates if the client agreed to place the deposit after the phone call.

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(prettyglm)
library(dplyr)
library(Hmisc)
data("bank")
```

### Pre-processing

A critical step for this package to work well is to **set all categorical predictors as factors**.

```{r preprocessing, echo=TRUE}
# Easiest way to convert multiple columns to a factor.
columns_to_factor <- c('job',
                       'marital',
                       'education',
                       'default',
                       'housing',
                       'loan')
bank_data  <- bank_data  %>%
  dplyr::mutate_at(columns_to_factor, list(~factor(.))) %>% # multiple columns to factor
  dplyr::mutate(age_cat = Hmisc::cut2(age, g=30, levels.mean=T)) %>% #cut age variable into categories
  dplyr::mutate(T_DEPOSIT = as.factor(base::ifelse(y=='yes',1,0))) #convert target to 0 and 1 for performance plots
```

### Building a glm

For this example we will build a glm using `stats::glm()`, however `prettyglm` also supports parsnip and workflow model objects which use the `glm` model engine.

Note the point of this README is not to create the best model, but to highlight the features of this package.

```{r build model, echo=TRUE}
deposit_model <- stats::glm(T_DEPOSIT ~ job +
                                marital +
                                education +
                                default +
                                loan +
                                age_cat,
                             data = bank_data,
                             family = binomial)
```

### Visualising Fitted Model Coefficients

#### Create table of model coefficients with `pretty_coefficients()`

* `pretty_coefficients()` automatically includes categorical variable base levels.
* You can complete a type III test on the coefficients by specifying a `type_iii` argument.
* You can include a "relativity" column in the output by including a `relativity_transform` input. (Note "relativity" is sometimes referred to as "likelihood" or "odds-ratio", you can change the title of this column with the `relativity_label` input.)
* You can return the data set instead of `kable` but setting `Return_Data =  TRUE`

```{r visualise coefficients type iii, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
pretty_coefficients(deposit_model, type_iii = 'Wald')
```

</p>

#### Create plots of the model relativities with `pretty_relativities()`

* A model relativity is a transform of the model estimate. By default `pretty_relativities()` uses 'exp(estimate)-1' which is useful for GLM's which use a log or logit link function.
* `pretty_relativities()` automatically extracts the training data from the model object and plots th  number of records on the second y axis.
* If the variable you are plotting is a continuous variable which has been split into buckets, you can set `plot_factor_as_numeric` equal to `TRUE` to plot the x axis on a numerical scale.

```{r visualise relativitiy, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
pretty_relativities(feature_to_plot = 'job',
                    model_object = deposit_model)
```

<p align="center">
  <img src= './man/figures/job_rel.png' height="500" align="center"/>
</p>


```{r visualise relativitiy with numberic, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
pretty_relativities(feature_to_plot = 'age_cat',
                    model_object = deposit_model,
                    plot_factor_as_numeric = T)
```

  <img src= './man/figures/age_rels.png' height="500" align="center"/>
</p>

### Model Performance

#### Plot overall actual vs expected by predicted band with (still in development) ```actual_expected_bucketed```

```{r visualise actual_expected_bucketed, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
actual_expected_bucketed(Target_Variable = 'T_DEPOSIT',
                         Model_Object = deposit_model,
                         Data_Set = bank_data)
```
