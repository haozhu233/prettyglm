<p>A model relativity is a transform of the model estimate. By default
<code><a href="../../reference/pretty_relativities.html">pretty_relativities()</a></code> uses ‘exp(estimate)-1’ which is
useful for GLM’s which use a log or logit link function.</p>
<p>The term ‘relativity’ is some times referred to as “odds-ratio” or
“Likelihood”. You can customize the label with the
<code>relativity_label</code> input.</p>
